## Introduction

This repository is the Git Log Viewer as described in these blog posts:

* [Git Log Viewer: Part 1](https://counihan.co.za/blog/Git-Log-Viewer-Part-1/)
* [Git Log Viewer: Part 2](https://counihan.co.za/blog/Git-Log-Viewer-Part-2/)

This version is the 2nd iteration, in an attempt to make the in-house Git Log version
work off HashIDs instead of version numbers

It is still a work in progress, so if you have suggestions or PR's please submit them.
